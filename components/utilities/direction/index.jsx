/*
 * Use this React context to wrap your component(s) to specify direction. Use either `DIRECTIONS.LTR` (ltr) or `DIRECTIONS.LTR` (rtl).
 * It's also expected that the `HTML` document of your markup has `dir='ltr'` or `dir='rtl'` attribute set.
 * The dir attribute is essential to set the direction of text to display and enable HTML in right-to-left.
 * For instance, setting `dir='rtl'` will cause block elements and table columns to start on the right and flow from right to left.
 *
 * Note: This context is prefixed with UNSAFE because it is not a publicly supported feature.
 *
 * Example on how to use the context to set your component right-to-left:
 * <UNSAFE_DirectionSettings.Provider value="rtl">
 *      <Combobox ... />
 * </UNSAFE_DirectionSettings.Provider>
